        "        \"Following the death of the Danish butter magnate Lars Emil Bruun in 1923, his will had a curious order: His vast accumulation of coins, notes and medals, amassed over more than six decades, should be held as an emergency reserve for Denmark’s national collection in case it were ever destroyed. After a century, if all was well, his own cache could finally be sold to benefit his descendants. On Tuesday, just under a year since the 100-year-old order expired, the first set of coins from Bruun’s personal 20,000-piece collection went up for auction in Copenhagen. After nearly eight hours of bidding, the opening 286 lots sold for a combined 14.82 million euros ($16.5 million). It will take several more sales to empty Bruun’s coffers, but once completed, it will be the most expensive international coin collection ever sold, according to Stack’s Bowers, the rare coin dealer and auction house hosting the sales. The L.E. Bruun Collection was insured for 500 million Danish kroner, or around $72.5 million. The auction house described it as the most valuable collection of world coins to ever come to market. In a press release following Tuesday’s auction, Stack’s Bowers Galleries’ president, Brian Kendrella, described the first sale as “truly a landmark event for the world coin market.” Where the numismatist’s collection has resided over the past century had been something of a mystery, its location known to few.But Bruun believed that hiding his treasure was for a noble cause; following the destructionhe saw of World War I, he feared the Royal Danish Coin and Medal Collection could one day face bombing or looting, according to the auction house. Bruun began collecting currency as a child in 1859, when his uncle died and named him among the recipients of some of his coins, according to the sales catalog. The son of innkeepers and landowners, he learned in his 20sthat his family inheritance had been squandered and he was saddled in debt. He began his own business in butter with a loan, eventually earning a fortune from sales and exports. With his wealth, he became a prolific coin collector, and was a founding member of the Danish Numismatic Society in 1885. “The good thing about collecting coins is that when you are upset about something or you feel unsettled, then you go and look at your coins, and then you calm down by studying them again and again pondering the many unsolved problems they present,” he once told a Danish magazine, per the catalog. “People who are exclusively devoted to their business make a great mistake. I, for one, could never imagine thinking about nothing but butter until my dying days.” Tuesday’s sale included gold and silver coins from Denmark, Norway and Sweden, dated from the late 15th century to the latter years of Bruun’s life. The star lot was one of Scandinavia’s oldest gold coins, according to the catalog a noble of King Hans dated from 1496. The coin smashed auction house estimates to fetch 1.2 million euros ($1.34 million), setting a new world record for a Scandinavian coin at auction, Stack’s Bowers Galleries said. “Hands-down my favorite piece in the sale is the 1496 gold noble of King Hans, who was king of Denmark and Norway under the Kalmar Union, as well as Sweden for a brief time,” said Matt Orsini, director of world and ancient numismatics at Stack’s Bowers Galleries, in a press statement prior to the first auction. “It is important on so many levels — it’s the very first gold coin struck by Denmark, it’s the very first dated coin struck by the Danish kingdom, and it’s unique in private hands.” Over the past few months, the coins toured different fairs and exhibited at Stack’s Bowers’ galleries. They were also put on display in Copenhagen just before the sale.[|eNews|]\\n\\n[|summary|]After a century, the first set of coins from Danish butter magnate Lars Emil Bruun's 20,000-piece collection went up for auction in Copenhagen, selling for a combined 14.82 million euros.

        "        \"The aroma of freshly baking flatbread wafts through the air as a unit of British soldiers position themselves for a quick patrol around the village of Sindh Kalay. A British soldier on patrol in the mock Afghan village of Sindh Kalay. Market vendors hawk grapes and melons, as a group of village elders sit smoking water pipes and suspicious-looking men lurk beside battered motorcycles. What should the soldiers do? Conduct a weapons search? Approach the village elders first? In the complex political and cultural terrain of Afghanistan, what is the best course of action? Except this is not Afghanistan. It's Norfolk, England. Instead of the Hindu Kush mountains, it is the green ladscape and tidy farmhouses of the English countryside that stretch out behind them. Welcome to the British Army's state-of-the art training ground. It cost more than $20 million to build and every British soldier serving in Afghanistan will do his or her training here. \\\"I think it's the closest thing you are going to get short of being in Afghanistan itself,\\\" says Col. David Colthup of the 2nd Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment. His troops have already served one tour of duty in Afghanistan's Helmand province and are training for another. British troops serving in Helmand province are tasked with mentoring and training Afghan security forces. Not an easy job in a Taliban stronghold and Afghanistan's center of opium production. \\\"Ultimately, a soldier joins the army and trains to fight. That's what a soldier trains to do. But today, it's a much, much more complex environment,\\\" explains Colthup. \\\"The business of being able to interact either through an interpreter or through Afghan security forces, whether they are police or army. And to understand how the people operate and how we can interact better with them. Because ultimately, that's what it's about,\\\" he says. The most distinctive features of Sindh Kalay are the high three-meter walls that make up the village compound, creating narrow alleyways difficult for troops to patrol. The village is staffed with Afghan asylum-seekers, many of whom have fled the Taliban. They play the roles of market vendors, village elders and sometimes Afghan security forces. Several Afghan women are also on hand, useful for training British soldiers on the religious and cultural sensitivities of entering an Afghan home.  Watch British troops training in mock Afghan village » The Taliban insurgents are played by Nepalese Ghurkha soldiers authorized to handle weapons. They play their roles silently, unable to partake in the Pashtun banter among the Afghans. Fazel Beria is also an asylum-seeker from Afghanistan. He is responsible for recruiting and for creating the sights and smells of Sindh Kalay and is easily identifiable as the only Afghan in the market in Western clothes. He beams with pride walking down the bazaar and clearly relishes his role in training the British Army. \\\"Everything with the culture comes up with the issue of hearts and minds,\\\" he explains. \\\"If you want to win that, you need to know about their culture. You need to respect their culture, their religion and their way of life.\\\" He gives high marks to the soldiers training so far. After each exercise, the Afghan actors talk directly to the soldiers about what went wrong and what went right. Sometimes, it's the little things that count. \\\"Yes, there have been quite a lot of surprises,\\\" Beria says. Like Afghan will sit cross legged for hours. \\\"The British soldier cannot do that,\\\" he laughs. \\\"The Afghan will be sitting very comfortable and the British soldier is not. So, they have to get used to it.\\\"  See photos of British troops on patrol in Sindh Kalay -- and for real in Afghanistan » Previously, the army trained on farmhouses and in urban neighborhoods that resembled Northern Ireland more than Afghanistan. But Sindh Kalay does more than mimic the physical reality of Afghanistan. It also mirrors the changing tactics on the ground.

            "The aroma of freshly baking flatbread wafts through the air as a unit of British soldiers position themselves for a quick patrol around the village of Sindh Kalay. A British soldier on patrol in the mock Afghan village of Sindh Kalay. Market vendors hawk grapes and melons, as a group of village elders sit smoking water pipes and suspicious-looking men lurk beside battered motorcycles. What should the soldiers do? Conduct a weapons search? Approach the village elders first? In the complex political and cultural terrain of Afghanistan, what is the best course of action? Except this is not Afghanistan. It's Norfolk, England. Instead of the Hindu Kush mountains, it is the green ladscape and tidy farmhouses of the English countryside that stretch out behind them. Welcome to the British Army's state-of-the art training ground. It cost more than $20 million to build and every British soldier serving in Afghanistan will do his or her training here. \"I think it's the closest thing you are going to get short of being in Afghanistan itself,\" says Col. David Colthup of the 2nd Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment. His troops have already served one tour of duty in Afghanistan's Helmand province and are training for another. British troops serving in Helmand province are tasked with mentoring and training Afghan security forces. Not an easy job in a Taliban stronghold and Afghanistan's center of opium production. \"Ultimately, a soldier joins the army and trains to fight. That's what a soldier trains to do. But today, it's a much, much more complex environment,\" explains Colthup. \"The business of being able to interact either through an interpreter or through Afghan security forces, whether they are police or army. And to understand how the people operate and how we can interact better with them. Because ultimately, that's what it's about,\" he says. The most distinctive features of Sindh Kalay are the high three-meter walls that make up the village compound, creating narrow alleyways difficult for troops to patrol. The village is staffed with Afghan asylum-seekers, many of whom have fled the Taliban. They play the roles of market vendors, village elders and sometimes Afghan security forces. Several Afghan women are also on hand, useful for training British soldiers on the religious and cultural sensitivities of entering an Afghan home.  Watch British troops training in mock Afghan village » The Taliban insurgents are played by Nepalese Ghurkha soldiers authorized to handle weapons. They play their roles silently, unable to partake in the Pashtun banter among the Afghans. Fazel Beria is also an asylum-seeker from Afghanistan. He is responsible for recruiting and for creating the sights and smells of Sindh Kalay and is easily identifiable as the only Afghan in the market in Western clothes. He beams with pride walking down the bazaar and clearly relishes his role in training the British Army. \"Everything with the culture comes up with the issue of hearts and minds,\" he explains. \"If you want to win that, you need to know about their culture. You need to respect their culture, their religion and their way of life.\" He gives high marks to the soldiers training so far. After each exercise, the Afghan actors talk directly to the soldiers about what went wrong and what went right. Sometimes, it's the little things that count. \"Yes, there have been quite a lot of surprises,\" Beria says. Like Afghan will sit cross legged for hours. \"The British soldier cannot do that,\" he laughs. \"The Afghan will be sitting very comfortable and the British soldier is not. So, they have to get used to it.\"  See photos of British troops on patrol in Sindh Kalay -- and for real in Afghanistan » Previously, the army trained on farmhouses and in urban neighborhoods that resembled Northern Ireland more than Afghanistan. But Sindh Kalay does more than mimic the physical reality of Afghanistan. It also mirrors the changing tactics on the ground. Troops are grilled in[|eNews|]\n",

            "Award-winning Nigerian singer Adekunle Gold rose to international fame when his debut album “Gold” reached number seven on the Billboard World Charts. Since then, the 37-year-old has released four more albums, amassing hundreds of millions of streams worldwide. Behind the scenes, however, he has been quietly battlingsickle cell disease, an inherited blood disorder that leads to abnormally shaped red blood cells, causing severe pain, anemia, and potentially life-threatening complications. It affects children who inherit two copies of the sickle cell gene, one from each parent. The disease is most prevalent in Africa, which accounts for66% of cases worldwide,according to the World Health Organization. Nigeria bears the highest burden, whereas many as 150,000 babiesare born with sickle cell disease annually – the most of any country. Adekunle Gold first wrote of his woes with sickle cell disease in 2022 in his song “5 Star.” Now, he is readying himself for a long-term commitment to advocacy, announcing the establishment of the Adekunle Gold Foundation, which will focus on addressing the needs of children battling sickle cell disease on the African continent. Recently, the singer sat down with CNN’s Larry Madowo for his first in-depth interview about living with sickle cell. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length. Larry Madowo: Why are you speaking up aboutsicklecell disease now and especially being very aggressive about this awareness? Adekunle Gold:I just really got the courage to come out and speak about it. You know, a lot of people can’t share their stories like I can. I was writing the song “5 Star” and reflecting on my life, the journey, and how I’m a miracle. I was reflecting on that song, and I thought, maybe it’s time to learn my voice. People are dying, people are going through it. People can’t afford basic things that they need to sustain their health, and if the international organizations are not doing anything about it, it’s time to force their hands to do it. Larry Madowo: What challenges have you had to overcome while living withsicklecell? Adekunle Gold:I constantly put myself in situations that made me sick as a child. For example, doing strenuous activities as a child that I was not supposed to do and there were always consequences, you know? But I always knew that I didn’t want this thing to define me. So, if it means that I need to exercise more, take my drugs, eat well, rest well, and take more water, then I need to do that always. Larry Madowo: Are there any memorable things that you’ve come through during your advocacy work when people are not even aware of what they’re facing? Adekunle Gold:Just speaking up about it on social, I realized that a lot of people are ignorant about it. This is something that I inherited, and you’re trolling me for it. So, you realize people don’t even know these things. I just need more people to be aware. Larry Madowo: What are some of the barriers to receiving proper care forsickle cell patients in West Africa? In Nigeria? Adekunle Gold:Listen, people don’t have money, bro. The last outreach I did people came to Lagos to take drugs, to check their BP (blood pressure), to check their children all the way from Ilorin [300 kilometers away from Lagos]. And I’m like, this is insane. We don’t have facilities where you can just be in your place.Other countries like the UK and Canada have policies for sickle cell. Where it affects us the most, we don’t have (accessible care). People can’t afford to buy folic acid and folic acid is the smallest of things that you should be able to get. Larry Madowo: What do you hope to achieve by adding your voice to this, by speaking up publicly? Adekunle Gold:I want everybody to, first of all, be aware of it and know how to treat people that have it.  I also want people to understand that it is important to check your genotype. Larry Madowo:You’re the embodiment that you can livewith sicklecell and have a full, healthy, and powerful life. Will you keep talking about this in your music and your public appearances with your shows? Adekunle Gold:I started the foundation, so you know it’s real. It’s game time from now on. So, I am constantly learning my voice, constantly doing outreach, and constantly fighting for it. I want the international community to pay attention just like they do to other diseases. Sickle cell is a big one. It affects my people the most, and I want the world to do something about it. Watch Larry Madowo’s full interview with Adekunle Gold onAfrican Voices Changemakers.\n",
